# Quasar

## Introdution
### What is Quasar?
The first installment of the Mass Effect trilogy features a minigame called "Quasar," portrayed as a casino game wherein the player must add random numbers to the score.

#### Objective
The objective is to get the total to twenty or as close as possible without going over.

#### Gameplay
Numbers are added to the score in one of two ways.  Players can either add a randomly generated number between 4 and 7, or between 1 and 8.

##### Variations
There are two different varieties of Quasar. One with low stakes and another with high stakes.  The low stakes has a cost of 20 credits to play with a maximum payout of 40, whereas the high stakes has a cost of 200 credits with a maximum payout of 400.

#### Winning Conditions
Scoring between 16 and 20 will count as a win, and at any result the player has the option to either receieve a pay out or roll again to try for a higher reward.

Payouts are rewarded as such (in terms of return on investment)
- 0-15: No Payout
- 16:   0%
- 17:   25%
- 18:   50%
- 19:   75%
- 20:   100%
- 21+:  -100%

For the sake of clarity, the payouts for a low stakes game of quasar would be the following:
- 0-15: 0
- 16:   20
- 17:   25
- 18:   30
- 19:   35
- 20:   40
- 21+:  0
